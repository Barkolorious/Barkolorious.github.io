      "statement": "My friend borealis aka Elif Bengisu Gezder didn't have any profile picture so I wanted to design a logo for her to use. Her username is coronaborealis or borealis for short and she is interested in music so I tried to combine these two. I called it scorealis.\nI used the music symbols and the constellation. The duration of notes approximately represents the size of the stars.\nShe liked the design so she used it. However, now she doesn't use it bu I don't know why."

      "statement": "One day when I was talking to my brother I had an amazing idea. Nowadays, there are so many concept coffee shops and why not open a one with a communism concept, maybe you could open it in METU.\nIf you haven't figured it out yet, the name is a word play on \"Das Kapital\". I think it is funny.\nIn the first sketch I wanted the logo to be a coffee cup. But my brother suggested it to be a coffee pot. I think it's better. You can see the sickle as a part of the handle with the spoon standing for the hammer.\nThe font is \"Bourgeois\" the font of METU and it looks similar to Cyrillic alphabet."
