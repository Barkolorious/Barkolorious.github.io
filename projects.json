      "statement": "My friend borealis aka Elif Bengisu Gezder didn't have any profile picture so I wanted to design a logo for her to use. Her username is coronaborealis or borealis for short and she is interested in music so I tried to combine these two. I called it scorealis.\nI used the music symbols and the constellation. The duration of notes approximately represents the size of the stars.\nShe liked the design so she used it. However, now she doesn't use it bu I don't know why."
